üõ∞Ô∏è Sentinel-2 Imagery Analysis for Land Cover and Vegetation Monitoring in Bali
A comprehensive Google Earth Engine (GEE) script for analyzing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery over Bali, Indonesia (January‚ÄìJuly 2025). This tool provides advanced remote sensing capabilities for land cover classification, vegetation monitoring, and environmental assessment using state-of-the-art spectral indices and machine learning algorithms.
üåü Key Features

Multi-Spectral Index Analysis: NDVI, SAVI, and NDWI calculations for comprehensive vegetation and water body assessment
Advanced Cloud Masking: Automated cloud filtering for improved image quality
Land Use/Land Cover Classification: Random Forest machine learning algorithm for accurate LULC mapping
Accuracy Assessment: Statistical validation of classification results
Data Visualization: Interactive composite image displays and thematic maps
Export Capabilities: Direct export to Google Drive for further analysis

üî¨ Spectral Indices
NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)

Purpose: Vegetation health and density assessment
Formula: (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)
Applications: Crop monitoring, deforestation detection, vegetation stress analysis

SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index)

Purpose: Vegetation analysis with soil background correction
Formula: ((NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red + L)) √ó (1 + L), where L = 0.5
Applications: Sparse vegetation areas, agricultural monitoring

NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)

Purpose: Water body detection and moisture content assessment
Formula: (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)
Applications: Water mapping, flood monitoring, irrigation assessment
